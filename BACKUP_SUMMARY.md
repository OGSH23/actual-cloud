## ðŸŽ‰ Safe Experimentation Enabled

You can now:
1. **Safely experiment** with removing SQLite dependencies
2. **Try different approaches** to client-side compatibility
3. **Test new PostgreSQL features** without fear of losing work
4. **Instantly rollback** if anything breaks
5. **Share stable versions** with others via tags

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedures

If anything goes wrong:
